=head1 NAME

Filter::Undent - Un-indent heredoc strings automatically

=head1 VERSION

Version 1.0

=cut

our $VERSION = '1.0';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Don't you wish heredocs could align with your docs?  Now they can!

	use Filter::Undent;
	print <<'EOF'
		What is printed is magically undented to the level of the
		first line of the heredoc.

			Only these lines will be indented in the output, since they
			are indented relative to the first line
	EOF

If you want to disable the unindent of the heredocs, simply:

	no Filter::Undent;

=cut

FILTER_ONLY
	quotelike => sub { s{<<}{undent <<}gs },
    all => sub {
		return unless $Filter::Undent::DEBUG;
		print STDERR join '', map { "Filter::Undent> $_\n" } split /\n/, $_;
	},
;

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 undent "string to un-indent"

This function does the actual work of unindenting.  It takes in a string,
ignores any leading newlines, and if the first line of the provided string is
indented with space or tab characters, it will remove the same whitespace from
the beginning of all of the subsequent lines.  Any lines which are outdented
from the first line, or is using a different combination of spaces or tabs,
will not have its leading space removed.

=cut

sub undent ($) {
	no warnings 'uninitialized';
	if ($_[0] =~ m/^(\r?\n)*([ \t]+)/) {
		my $i = $2;
		return join '', map { s/^\Q$i\E/$1/g; $_ } grep { $_ ne '' }
			split /(.*?\n)/, $_[0];
	}
	return $_[0];
}
